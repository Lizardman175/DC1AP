# Dark Cloud 1 Randomizer

Home of Dark Cloud 1 randomizer for Archipelago

## Requirements
- Windows only for now
- Install PCSX2 1.7+
- Legally obtained copy of Dark Cloud 1 NTSC version
- Install [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en)
- Download and install the dc1.apworld file from the latest release like normal ('run' the .apworld file)
- Download the client .exe from the latest release

## Running the game
- Generate a game with Archipelago
- Start the server
- Start the game on PCSX2
- Start the client
- Click the burger icon in the client, put in host/slot/password info and click connect. Make sure to connect before entering the dungeon!

## Things of note
- Save states are not 100% supported yet.  If you must use them, reset the game before loading the state.  Otherwise consider closing the client if save stating for perfect score on duels.
- For multiworlds, consider forcing "Progressive Gaffer's Buggy" and "Progressive Paige's House" local.  These are logically required for Xiao so this will ensure they're always in the first half of the DBC so you don't have to wait for a shop.
- Due to game mechanics, georama can only be received in dungeons.  If you are waiting for an item from another world, hang out in a dungeon floor for a bit.
- If you aren't seeing a miracle chest try these steps before posting:
  - Chests won't spawn until you've entered the local dungeon once, don't forget to do that first!
  - Use R2 for first person camera.  Some chests are tricky to find
  - Go into a dungeon to receive georama.  It might be logically available on the tracker, but the required georama is missing in your inventory.
  - Some chests may show logically available but not be seen if you haven't recruited a character that is now available.
  - If the above fails, dm me or ask in the Dark Cloud thread
